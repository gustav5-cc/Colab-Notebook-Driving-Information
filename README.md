# San Francisco Traffic Stop Analysis

For this project we took a look at data from SF Police aout traffic stops, when they occurred, 
what age, gender, race, and other demographics to identify any trends in traffic or bias in stops.

Clicking on the notebook .ipynb will show you our report. But feel free to download it and import it
into your own notebook and play around with the results

We used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to create the graphs, and heatmaps throughout the report
